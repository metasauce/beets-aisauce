# Beets AI Sauce Plugin
*Because your tunes deserve a little extra flavor.*

Welcome to the **Beets AI Sauce Plugin**, that lets artificial intelligence take a stab at 
figuring out what your mystery tracks are all about.

---


## Who Needs This? (Definitely You)

- **You**: The person who once gazed at your MP3 folder and thought, "My beats need more AI jazz hands!"
- **Also You**: If you trust a chatbot more than your buddy Dave who keeps calling every track "Track 1".
- **Definitely You**: If you've got folders full of unlabeled files from random rips, mystery MP3s, or bootlegs you swear are real.

## Features

- **Auto-Metadata Magic**: Summon track titles, album info, artist bios, and more from the mysterious AI realm.
- **MORE**: TODO

## Installation

1. **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have Beets installed (`pip install beets`), an API key for your preferred AI service, and **zero shame** about using AI.
2. **Grab the Sauce**:
   ```bash
   pip install beets-aisauce
    ```
3. **Configure the Plugin**: Add the plugin to your Beets configuration file (`config.yaml`):
    ```yaml
    plugins: 
       - aisauce
    ```
4. Stop thinking and let the AI do the heavy lifting.
